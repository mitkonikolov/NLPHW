In order to run my POS Tagger, please open the file Solution (Solution.java)
from the src folder. Please run the main method in any IDE and the program
will:
1. read from a file called "train.counts"
2. calculate all necessary probabilities for the Hidden Markov model
3. generate tags for all words from test.words
4. store them in a file called test.tags.

The program assumes that the files train.counts and test.words are available
in the directory of the project (in the folder POS Tagger).
